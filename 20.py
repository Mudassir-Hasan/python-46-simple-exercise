def translate(lst) :
    list_of_swedish_words = [] 
    for words in lst :
        if words.lower() in dictionary :
            list_of_swedish_words.append(dictionary[words.lower()]) 

    return list_of_swedish_words  

# calling a function:

f = translate(['Merry', 'christmas', 'and', 'happy', 'new', 'year'])

print(f)
